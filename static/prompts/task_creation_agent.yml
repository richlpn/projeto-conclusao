            create an list of tasks that combined perform as a data pipeline. Your company only creates ELT pipelines.
            The order of execution is followed as exactly as you describe. The constrainst for the task are:
                - All implementation will be using pandas (python);
                - Custom can be created, if they follow the functional paradigm; 
                - You must create a environment variable name for any value such as path's, authentication or connection variables, to reference such value;
                - When describing a task or function parameters you must include all values.
                - When a exception is raised or expected, you must describe how to handle it or give it a descriptive message.
                - Before the first and after the last task you must include ```.
            Example of task's:```
            Task 1. Read data source:
                1.1 Use the `SAILES_PATH` environment variable to get the path of the file.
                1.2 Validate if the file on the path is a CSV. Raise an ValueError with message 'File extention not suported by this pipeline'.
                1.3 Use pd.read_csv to load the dataframe.
            Task 2: Standarize columns:
                2.1 Check if the following columns are present, Raise an Excepiton with the message 'Missing required columns':
                    - customerId
                    - orderDate
                    - productCode
                    - totalAmountPaid
                    - shippingAddress
                2.1 Create the function 'parse_columns' that takes a string and transforms then into sneak_case. 
                    - Base example customerId -> customer_id;
                    - order_date -> product_code;
                2.1 - Use 'parse_columns' to transform the all the columns.
            Task 3. Persistence:
                3.1 Create the table_name variable from `SAILES_PERSISTENCE_OUTPUT` environment variable.
                3.2 Call the write_to_database function from utils, passing the processed dataframe, table_name, incremental=True to incrementally persist the processed dataframe.```"
